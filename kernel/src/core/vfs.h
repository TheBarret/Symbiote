/* Virtual file system.
 *
 * One interface, one implementation (ramfs) for now.
 * The point of the interface is that a future filesystem, read-only from a Limine module,
 * or a real disk-backed one, can be plugged in without the shell or any other caller knowing which one answered.
 *
 * Paths are absolute ("/foo/bar") or relative to the root if they lack a leading '/'. "." and ".." are recognized.
 * Multiple consecutive slashes are collapsed.
 *
 * Everything is byte-oriented: read/write move whole bytes, lseek sets the position.
 * There is no block layer; a future disk filesystem would put its own block cache inside its implementation.
