/* Physical memory manager.
 *
 * A bitmap with one bit per 4 KiB frame.
 * The bitmap itself lives in a usable region of physical memory, reached via the HHDM.
 * Init walks the Limine memory map:
 *   - marks every frame used,
 *   - marks USABLE regions free,
 *   - reserves the bitmap, the kernel image, and the framebuffer,
 *   - reserves frame 0 so pmm_alloc() returning 0 is unambiguously "out".
 *
 * No locking, single-threaded boot assumption, same as the rest of the kernel.
 * When SMP arrives this file is one of the places that will need a spinlock. */
